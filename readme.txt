______________________________________

This blog was created following DevMarketer's tutorials for the purpose of learning Laravel. The finished product, however, is very much usable!
It works as a CMS where a user can register and login to insert posts, create tags and categories, and where a non-logged user can visualize the blog posts and comment.

How to Use:

After migrating and seeding the tables, access the login with the credentials admin / 123456.
The seeds will create 10 random blogposts, with a few comments and an image on each.
